The GII model includes 131 countries/economies, which represent 93.5% of the world’s population. The GII relies on two sub-indices – the Innovation Input Sub-Index and the Innovation Output Sub-Index.\r\nThree measures are calculated: i)Innovation Input Sub-Index: Five input pillars capture elements of the national economy that enable innovative activities. The five pillars: Institutions, Human capital and research, Infrastructure, Market sophistication, and Business sophistication. ii)Innovation Output Sub-Index: Innovation outputs are the result of innovative activities within the economy. Although the Output Sub-Index includes only two pillars, it has the same weight in calculating the overall GII scores as the Input Sub-Index. The two pillars: Knowledge and technology outputs and Creative outputs. iii)The overall GII score is the average of the Input and Output Sub-Indices.\r\nThis project aims to analyse and identify patterns regarding the GII during Covid-19 pandemic. We intend to draw conclusions from the data and generate visualization of the data for the respective countries or regions especially in Singapore.\r\nMotivation and Objectives\r\nWe have chosen to explore a dataset describing the Global Innovation Index. The index is a ranking of the innovation capabilities and results of world economies. The data set contains information of 131 countries based on Global Innovation Index 2020 report.\r\nOur project aims to answer the following questions:\r\nWhich country or region rank the highest/lowest during Covid-19 pandemic?\r\nHow did country rank or score changes during pre and post Covid-19 pandemic?\r\nWhat are the countries that experience a significant increase or decrease in Innovation index during Covid-19 pandemic?\r\nWhat is the main factor that impacts the Global Innovation Score more significantly during Covid-19 pandemic?\r\nMethodology and Approach\r\nData Source\r\nhttps://www.globalinnovationindex.org/analysis-indicator\r\nExploratory Data Analysis\r\nEDA StoryboardChoropleth Map\r\nChoropleth Map for Happiness Index of the WorldAnalysis of Spatial Data: A Choropleth Map displaying the view of where each country is placed in the World ranking report (for example: darker shade for countries that have the highest rating while the lighter shade represents countries with a lower ranking). It will also be used to visualise the ranking for all the factors impacting the innovation index for individual countries, as well as for the region and clusters which will be determined by the hierarchical clustering later on.\r\nBubble Plot\r\nBubble PlotMultivariate graphical including Bubble Chart that displays multiple circles (bubbles) in a two-dimensional plot.\r\nVisualising Uncertainty\r\nVisualising UncertaintyTime-series Analysis\r\nTime-seriesIdentifying trends or patterns in the data over a time-period.\r\nStatistical Analysis\r\nStatistical Analysis StoryboardCorrelation Analysis\r\nCorrelation of various factorsMulti Linear Regression Model\r\nMultiple Linear Regression ModelTo estimate the relationship between the various factors impacting the innovation index, and the innovation index.\r\nHierarchical Clustering\r\nMultiple Linear Regression ModelTo understand how different countries relate to each other using the data provided, and how far apart data points are. From there, we will be able to identify various clusters.\r\nProposed R Packages\r\ncorrplot: Visualisation of a Correlation Matrix\r\ncluster: Cluster Analysis\r\nExPanDar: Explore Data Interactively\r\nggplot2: Create Data Visualization\r\nggiraph: Making ‘ggplot2’ Graphics Interactive\r\nggiraphExtra: Make Interactive ‘ggplot2’.

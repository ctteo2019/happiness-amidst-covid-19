The World Happiness Report 2020 surveys 156 countries around the world, ranking countries by their happiness levels. Countries are ranked on six key variables that support well-being: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and freedom from corruption.\r\nThe happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll which is: “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” (Also known as the “Cantril Ladder”.)\r\nThis project aims to analyse and identify patterns regarding the Happiness Score comparing pre-and post Covid-19 pandemic. We intend to draw conclusions from the data and generate visualization of the data for the respective countries or regions especially in Singapore.\r\nMotivation and Objectives\r\nWe have chosen to explore a dataset describing the Happiness Score based on the World Happiness Report 2020. The data set contains information of 156 countries based on an average of three years of surveys between 2017 and 2019 along with the factors used to explain the score.\r\nOur project aims to answer the following questions:\r\nWhich country or region rank the highest/lowest in overall Happiness during Covid-19 pandemic?\r\nHow did country rank or score changes during pre and post Covid-19 pandemic?\r\nWhat are the countries that experience a significant increase or decrease in Happiness during Covid-19 pandemic?\r\nWhat is the main factor that impacts the Happiness Score more significantly during Covid-19 pandemic?\r\nMethodology and Approach\r\nData Source\r\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report\r\nExploratory Data Analysis\r\nEDA StoryboardChoropleth Map\r\nChoropleth Map for Happiness Index of the WorldBubble Plot\r\nBubble PlotVisualising Uncertainty\r\nVisualising UncertaintyTime-series Analysis\r\nTime-seriesStatistical Analysis\r\nStatistical Analysis StoryboardCorrelation Analysis\r\nCorrelation of various factorsMulti Linear Regression Model\r\nMultiple Linear Regression ModelHierarchical Clustering\r\nMultiple Linear Regression ModelProposed R Packages\r\ncorrplot: Visualisation of a Correlation Matrix\r\ncluster: Cluster Analysis\r\nExPanDar: Explore Data Interactively\r\nggplot: Create Data Visualization\r\nggiraph: Making ‘ggplot2’ Graphics Interactive\r\nggiraphExtra: Make Interactive ‘ggplot2’.
